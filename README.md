# nuxtQuestions
for bugs and questions using nuxt.js

Two problems here isolated at the moment as follows.

## pixi.js import
Directives are given in nuxt.config.js and plugins/pixiPlug.js, as expected.
But PIXI is not available in the scripts.
Problem isolated in pages/pixiBug/, uncomment the lines at the start of the script tag to load PIXI from CDN...

## tree not matching
"client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching server-rendered content."
in a 13 lines vue file while using a v-for loop in an HTML table.
